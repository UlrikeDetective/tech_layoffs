VBA Solution for Removing Leading Spaces
For a more automated approach, you can use a VBA macro:

Press Alt + F11 to open the VBA editor.

Insert a new module by selecting Insert > Module.

Paste the following code:

vba
Copy code
Sub RemoveLeadingSpaces()
    Dim cell As Range
    For Each cell In Selection
        If Not IsEmpty(cell) Then
            cell.Value = LTrim(cell.Value)
        End If
    Next cell
End Sub
Close the VBA editor.

Select the range of cells you want to clean.

Press Alt + F8, select RemoveLeadingSpaces, and click Run.

This macro will remove only the leading spaces from all the selected cells.

By using either of these methods, you can efficiently remove leading spaces from many entries in Excel.
